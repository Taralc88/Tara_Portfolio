# Data Science Portfolio by Tara Connin
This portfolio showcases notebooks I developed to conduct data analysis and explore machine learning techniques.

## Project 1: [Home Credit Default Risk](https://github.com/Taralc88/Home-Credit.git)
* Kaggle Competition: [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk)
* Predicted loan defaults with an XGBoost model, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.76.
* Flagged the top 20% high-risk clients to cut the default rate from 8.07% to 4.90%.
* Identified $1.36 billion in annual savings through targeted risk management.
